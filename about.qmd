## Contributors to the guides

All of the dataset preparation guides presented here have been developed and written by a collaborative community of scientists, data managers, and repository users. This community draws heavily from the Information Management Committee of the the [U.S. Long-term Ecological Research Network (LTER)](https://lternet.edu), data specialists and curators at [EDI](https://edirepository.org), and numerous partners in the environmental research and data management communities. 

Many individuals from the community described above have contributed to these guides over the years. Individual contributors are listed in the title page, citation information, and/or document metadata for each guide. Please don't hesitate to reach out to the maintainers if anyone has been overlooked, or if information needs to be corrected.

**If you would like to contribute**, please read the [Contributing page](contributing.qmd) and contact the maintainers or representatives from the current working groups below.

## Community working groups

The ideas, words, and recommendations in these guides came to fruition as a result of many community working groups convening over periods of months to years.
