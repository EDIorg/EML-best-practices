TEST - This website contains a series of documents about preparing and publishing datasets in the environmental sciences and similar contexts. Topics include community-developed metadata standards, serialization and markup formatting guidelines, best practices for content in ecological synthesis datasets, and more. This documentation is maintained by the [Environmental Data Initiative](https://edirepository.org) (EDI) and all content has been developed and written in collaboration with EDI's community of scientists, data managers, and repository users.

**The purpose of these guides is to:**

- Provide guidance for creating published data products that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable [FAIR, @wilkinson_fair_2016]
- Augment the schema documentation for the Ecological Metadata Language [EML, @jones_ecological_2019]
- Facilitate the development and use of community-standard harmonized data products to improve data synthesis and integration

To contribute to these documents or participate in the associated working groups, see the [About](about.qmd) page or the repository [README](https://github.com/EDIorg/dataset_preparation_guides). For more on the history of this effort, and access to earlier editions of the guides, see the [History](history.qmd) page.
